          Said to be so wonderful that it is a "Spiritual Experience", the Marble Cathedral of Chile will present you
          with an awe-inspiring natural wonder. The Marble Cathedral is actually a series of caves, given its name due 
          to the amazing colors and reflections created by the cave. The structure is only accessible by boat and 
          several of the caverns are actually underwater. With the absurdly-blue water and the strangely reflective rock,
          this location is most definitely a sight to behold.

          Cano Cristales, a river in Colombian national park, presents its visitors with what has been called the most
          beautiful river in the world. The river, with clear water, has a bright red color to it with some yellow due
          to the algae that grows within. This results in an appearance unlike any other river! However, the algae 
          specifically grows from July to October, so be sure to visit in those months. Besides the river, the area around
          it is also great to visit. Within the national park, you will see incredible rock formations, savannahs, and wildlife.
